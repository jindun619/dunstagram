# Dunstagram

Dunstagram is a **React Native + TypeScript** project currently under development. It aims to replicate core features of a social media app, such as posting, browsing, and interacting with content. The app uses **React Navigation** for navigation, **React Query (TanStack)** for data fetching and caching, and **Styled Components** for styling. As of now, only the **Home Screen** has been partially implemented, with plans to expand to other screens like **My**, **New**, **Reels**, and **Search**.
